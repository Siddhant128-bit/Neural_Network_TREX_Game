# Neural_Network_TREX_Game
It is a simple TREX Game that User can also play, Train their Neural network to play, and make their BOT play it for them.

run  game_environment.py to play yourself 
run  real_time_trainning_and_trial.py the model will start to intiate train and adjust weights might need to run this 2-3 times

run initial_learning_phase1.py it initializes and adjusts weights from scratch
  for i in range(999999): change the value for number of iterations to train the neural network 
 
run Run_Trained_weights1.py to run the final model kiaded frin weights_so_far1.txt
